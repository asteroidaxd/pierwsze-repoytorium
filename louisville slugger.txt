Yeah, I know I'm a piece of shit
Got a hundred acre wrist
Ghost Mountain, Sematary
Posted in the forest
I could never love a bitch
Jus' remove thy shift
They might find your corpse, but I still love your spirit
Fastened to the five points
I don't care about anything
Cutters in a circle for
Weeping Virgin Mary
Got a wire Louisville
Mortals wanna try me
Beat him with my crucifix
Cut his fuckin' hands off
I'm living for the dead
I hope they believe in me
Crooked forest witcher
Tree house fire haunting
Took them girls' souls and locked 'em in a figurine
Chainsaw lord, I'm the Keeper Of The Trees
Silver chains blistering
Sylvia Plath seethering
Machete, Honda Civic, we be turnin' up in the trees
Sunrise, blood on me
Spiked bat eternal
Haunted Mound give you brain damage, sing with me
