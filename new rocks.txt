I got New Rocks, stomp your damn brain
Stupid heavy, custom made in Spain
I don't come around, I don’t show my face
Woke up this morning, said, "Fuck today"
Do you regret the choices that you've made?
He made a bad choice, I stomped his face
I got his headstone hangin' off my chain
Woke up this morning, said, "Fuck today"
I got New Rocks, stomp your damn brain
Stupid heavy, custom made in Spain
Never call me, don’t wanna talk today
Woke up this morning, said, "Fuck today"
Do you regret the choices that you've made?
He wasted his life, we dance on his grave
I got his headstone hangin' off my chain
Woke up this morning, said, "Fuck today"
